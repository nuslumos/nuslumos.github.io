# Welcome to Lab for Urban Mobility Systems at NUS

The mission of the Lab for Urban Mobility Systems (LUMOS) is to advance intelligent transportation systems, formulate new design and operational strategies, devise effective solutions to transportation problems, and bridge academic communities with industry to improve the mobility, reliability, and sustainability of transportation systems. 

We focus on future urban mobility and transport systems, which cover the areas of shared mobility system operation and design, travel demand and congestion management, and data-driven transportation system modeling and analysis. 

The research team develops multidisciplinary approaches to address research questions with theoretical contributions and real-world implications for efficient and sustainable transportation system planning and management. 

LUMOS aims to disseminate new insights, knowledge, and tools to academia, industry, government, and research organizations worldwide.
