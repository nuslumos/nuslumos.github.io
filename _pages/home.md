The mission of the Lab for Urban Mobility Systems (LUMOS) is to advance intelligent transportation systems, formulate new design and operational strategies, devise effective solutions to transportation problems, and bridge academic communities with industry to improve the mobility, reliability, and sustainability of transportation systems. We focus on future urban mobility and transport systems, which cover the areas of shared mobility system operation and design, travel demand and congestion management, and datadriven transportation system modeling and analysis. The research team develops multidisciplinary approaches to address research questions with theoretical contributions and real-world implications for efficient and sustainable transportation system planning and management. LUMOS aims to disseminate new insights, knowledge, and tools to academia, industry, government, and research organizations worldwide.

### Research
The lab’s primary interest is to better model and predict the behavior of transportation systems and develop future mobility solutions and technologies. We have developed research programs in the following domains.

1. **Shared Mobility System Design and Operations**: Shared mobility has been widely rec- ognized as an efficient means to ef- ficiently promote resource utilization and improve our standards of living. The lab develops research on shared autonomous electric vehicle systems, mixed f leet mobility-on-demand (MoD) systems with autonomous ve- hicles (AVs) and conventional vehicles (CVs), ridesharing and ride-hailing systems, and bike-sharing systems.
2. **Smart Congestion Management and Information Provision**: The past decades have witnessed the rapid development of information technologies in transportation systems. The dissemination of real-time travel information may guide travelers to choose modes and routes and schedule their trips to reduce travel times. We study information provision and develop modeling frameworks to predict the impacts of pretrip information and en-route information.
3. **Data-Driven Intelligent Traffic Diffusion Plan Generation**: Beginning in May 2020, we have been collaborating with ST Engineering on an artificial intelligence research program with the goal of building a people-centric, smart future for Singapore. Our project, “Intelligent Traffic Diffusion Plan Generation, Effective Assessment and Dissemination Strategies, aims to develop a framework to dynamically generate effective traffic diffusion plans as well as dissemination strategies to distribute guidance information to drivers in a timely manner. Intelligent tools, such as machine learning, deep reinforcement learning, traffic simulation, and optimization techniques, are used in this project.


### Collaborators
We work with closely with numerous collaborators, including [Prof. Meng Qiang](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/cee/staff/meng-qiang/) in NUS, [Prof. Nie Yu](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/nie-yu.html) in Northwestern, and xxxx.
