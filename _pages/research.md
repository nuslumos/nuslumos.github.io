## Shared Mobility System Design and Operations
<div style="text-align: justify">
Shared mobility has been widely recognized as an efficient means to efficiently promote resource utilization and improve our standards of living. The lab develops research on shared autonomous electric vehicle systems, mixed f leet mobility-on-demand (MoD) systems with autonomous vehicles (AVs) and conventional vehicles (CVs), ridesharing and ride-hailing systems, and bike-sharing systems.

<div style="text-align: justify">
We study two fundamental problems: long-run infrastructure design and short-run operational decisions and strategies for shared mobility systems. At the short-run operational level, we investigate optimal operational decisions and strategies, such as dynamic pricing and incentives, en-route matching, vehicle relay, and vehicle rebalancing, to improve the system efficiency and the level of service. For electric carsharing systems, we propose a space–time–battery network to explicitly track the battery states of vehicles. Efficient algorithms are developed to make optimal vehicle routing, assignment, and charging decisions quickly. Relay strategies are also proposed to address the “range anxiety” caused by the limited battery capacity of electric vehicles. By leveraging historical and online data, we propose a data-driven approach to implementing real-time operational strategies for carsharing systems in terms of vehicle assignment, relocation, and user incentive decisions. With the development of autonomous driving technology, a shared autonomous electric vehicle system is expected to be a promising transportation mode in the future. We further develop a two-sided deep reinforcement learning approach for dynamically managing MoD systems with a mixed autonomy of AVs and CVs (Figure 2), while human drivers’ behavior and uncertainty in trip requests are fully considered. The proposed approach is demonstrated using a case study in New York City, and our algorithms can make real-time, high-quality decisions. Efficient algorithms are developed to make these high-quality decisions quickly.

At the long-run infrastructure planning and design level, we focus on the design of infrastructure (i.e., fleet size, station capabilities, and multitype charging facility configurations) and the impacts of a sharing economy on road congestion. The optimal deployment of a charging infrastructure should consider its impact on the level of service at the operational level. To achieve this goal, we develop a two-stage stochastic program to integrate and optimize decision making at the planning and operational levels simultaneously. Numerical experiments in a large-scale case reveal the effectiveness of the optimal deployment of a multitype charging infrastructure in terms of system profit and performance. Meanwhile, the long-run implications of ridesharing on traffic congestion distribution over time and space are investigated using an equilibrium approach. We found that ridesharing is generally effective in relieving congestion, but it may also worsen congestion in certain areas. Also, our work reveals that ridesharing does reshape the traffic congestion evolution patterns over time during peak hours. Based on these results, we propose a joint design of compensation and congestion pricing schemes to reduce congestion and improve social welfare.

## Understanding the role of ASD genes
<div style="text-align: justify">
The genes discovered through exome sequencing provide an entree into the biology of ASD, hopefully as a foundation for developing theraputics. The Sanders Lab takes two research approaches: 1) To consider ASD-associated genes en masse to look for patterns of convergence [State MW, Šestan N Science 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22984058); 2) To investigate the genes with the strongest evidence of ASD association, such as SCN2A in depth.

Through the first approach, the Sanders Lab has helped delineate two major functional roles of ASD-associated genes: 1) gene expression regulators (GER), i.e. genes that influence the expression of other genes such as CHD8 and ARID1B; and 2) neuronal communication, such as SCN2A and NRXN1, see [De Rubeis et al. Nature 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25363760) and [Sanders et al. Neuron 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26402605). Co-expression analysis showed convergence across multiple ASD-associated genes during mid-fetal development in the prefrontal cortex and this result was driven by layer 5/6 glutamatergic neurons ([Willsey et al. Cell 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24267886)). Similar patterns have been identified through other systems-based approaches, reviewed in [Sanders Curr Opin Genet Dev 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26547130).

The second approach has focused mainly on the gene SCN2A and is performed in collaboration with the [Bender lab at UCSF](https://benderlab.ucsf.edu/research-projects), the [SCN2A family group](http://www.scn2a.org), and [Simons VIP](https://simonsvipconnect.org). By integrating genetic data across multiple cases and cohorts with structural data on the NaV1.2 protein encoded by SCN2A and electrophysiology, we demonstrated that loss-of-function mutations of SCN2A lead to ASD and developmental delay, while gain-of-function mutations lead to epileptic encephalopathy ([Ben-Shalom et al. 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28256214)).

## Copy number variants (CNVs) in autism spectrum 
<div style="text-align: justify">
My early publications describe the development of a novel approach to detecting de novo CNVs in Illumina SNP genotyping data and applying this to Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) families from the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC). While de novo CNVs had previously been associated with ASD (Sebat et al. 2007), our analysis of this cohort of 1,124 families, including unaffected siblings, allowed us to clarify the genomic architecture. In turn, this allowed us to develop a statistical approach to evaluating whether specific genomic loci are associated with ASD; four de novo duplications at 7q11.23 met these criteria for ASD association with reduced sociability and, notably, deletions at the same locus are associated with increased social behavior in William’s Syndrome. We have recently (2015) published a CNV analysis of all 2,591 families in the SSC. By integrating CNV and exome data we showed that small de novo deletions contain one critical ASD gene, while large de novo CNVs contain multiple ASD risk genes. We use this finding to identify six ASD risk CNV loci and 65 ASD risk genes. I led the analysis and write up of both projects including the development of novel approaches to CNV detection. Autism Speaks cited our 2011 CNV analysis as one of the top Ten Autism Research Achievements.
