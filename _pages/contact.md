# Open positions

Thank you for your interest in joining the Lab for Urban Mobility Systems.

## Graduate students

(Sample) Dr. Sanders is a member of the [Neuroscience graduate program (part of PIBS)](https://neurograd.ucsf.edu/about-neuroscience-graduate-program) and the [Pharmaceutical Sciences and Pharmacogenomics (PSPG) graduate program](https://pspg.ucsf.edu), which is part of the [Quantitative Biosciences Consortium (QBC)](https://qbc.ucsf.edu). If you are interested in a rotation in the Sanders Lab, please contact Dr. Sanders directly using the details on his [USCF profile page](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/stephan.sanders). We are primarily a computational lab working on the genetics of neurodevelopmental disorders, so a background in coding and/or genetics helps students make the most of their rotation.

(Sample) If you are interested, please contact Dr. Sanders directly using the details on his [USCF profile page](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/stephan.sanders).

## Postdoctoral researchers

(Sample) We have more data and research ideas than trainees, so are keen to recruit exceptional researchers. The lab offers a collaborative and supportive environment and has a strong track record in helping students develop and begin their own independent research careers. The lab has expertise in high-performance computing and analytical pipelines, allowing novel analytic methods to be performed at scale. We are currently looking for researchers with a strong computational background in:
